* **Connection pins:**
	* SWITCH1 = 3

	* SWITCH2  = 4

	* SWITCH3  = 5

	* SWITCH4  = 7

	* SWITCH5  = 8

	* SWITCH6  = 10
 
* **Connect Relay to Raspberry PI:**
	* Connect GND pin of the Relay with GND pin of the Raspberry PI
	* Connect VCC pin of the Relay with 5V pin of the Raspberry PI

* **Setup:**
The structure is very simple since all pins are labelled. Left (GND) comes to pin 6 of the Pi (GND), the right pin (VCC) comes to 3V3 (pin 1) of the Pis. Depending on how many of the relays you want to control, you need to connect a corresponding number of GPIOs to the IN pins. It is recommended to set a small resistor between the Pi and the relay, but it is not absolutely necessary with 3V3.  
If you set 5V instead of 3.3V to VCC, you should definitely put one resistor each (~ 1kÎ©) between the GPIOs and the IN pins.


##  2. Installing software:  <a name="install"></a>

#### Requirements:

1.  Shunya OS supported Development board (RaspberryPi 4)
2.  Power supply for the board (5V 3A power supply for RaspberryPi 4)
3.  microSD card
4.  microSD card Reader
5.  Laptop/PC

#### Steps are :

1.  First we load Shunya OS on your board.
2.  Boot up Shunya OS

#### Install Etcher:Etcher allows you to Flash Shunya OS on the micro-SD card.
 For Ubuntu 16.04 installing Etcher is Simple, download the executable file and Run.

1.  Download  [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)  for Linux.
2.  Extract the zip file.
3.  Run AppImage  `sudo ./balenaEtcher-xxx.AppImage`

#### Flash Shunya OS

1.  Download  [Shunya OS](http://releases.shunyaos.org/1.0-beta/)
    
2.  Extract Downloaded zip file, by Right clicking on the downloaded zip file and selecting "Extract Here".
    
3.  `.img`  file in the extracted folder contains Shunya OS.
    
4.  Insert SD card with Card reader.
    
5.  Open Etcher program.
    
6.  Click Select Image.
    
7.  Select Shunya OS file  `shunya-{type}-image-{board-name}.img`  file.
    
    _For example_:  `shunya-console-image-raspberry4.img`
    
    ##### NOTE
    
    -   Shunya OS released in 3 variants
        
        -   tiny - Extremely Small footprint image use only for final deployment.
        -   minimal - Small footprint image use only for final deployment testing.
        -   console - Full console only image use only for development.
    -   At this stage it is recommended that you use  **console**  variant
        
    
8.  Your SDCard should be auto detected in Etcher.
9.  Click on Flash.
10.  Now Etcher will load the Shunya OS on your SD card.
11.  Now you can boot up the Shunya OS on your board.
    

#### Booting Up with Shunya OS
1.  Insert the micro-SD card into the board.
2.  Connect peripherals like Keyboard, Mouse and HDMI monitor.
3.  Connect Power Supply.

The board should boot up with Shunya OS.

#### Login to Shunya

Login with these credentials:

-   Username : shunya
-   Password : shunya

1.  This will bring you to Terminal inside the board.
2.  Now you can download, build and run the code using inside the board.
